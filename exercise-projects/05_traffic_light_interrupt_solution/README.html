    <h3>Solution 5</h3>
    <h2>Interruptable Traffic Light</h2>
    <p>In this exercise you modeled a statechart extension using a test driven approach. 
      The result should be comparable to the follwing statechart... </p>

            switch the yellow light on and off. Timed transitions between these states ensure correct timing for blinking.</td>
