    <h3>Exercise 3</h3>
    <h2>Traffic Light Testing</h2>
    <p>How do we make sure that the traffic light  works according to the defined requirements? <br/>
      You will learn how to define tests for statecharts.</p>

      <h1>Inspecting and running the prepared tests.</h1>
      <p>
        This exercise includes the traffic light statechart from the previous exercises. 
        Additionally it includes prepared SCTUnit test cases which must be extended. First take a look at the 
        test cases and the execute them. 
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Open the sctunit file <b>TrafficLightTests.sctunit</b> by double-clicking the 
            file in the project explorer.</li>
          <li>Take a look at the existing tests.</li>
          <li>Execute the tests: witin the editor right-click and choose 'Run As > SCT Unit' 
            from the context menu.</li>
          <li>The testing perspective should be activated and you should see the <i>Junit</i> 
            and <i>Coverage</i> views on the right (see image above).</li>
          <li>Select an entry from the coverage view to visualize the coverage information on the statechart.</li>
        </ul>
  
      <h1>Complete the tests</h1>
        <p>
          The <i>Junit</i> and <i>Coverage</i> views indicate that:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The tests are incomplete because the coverage is not at 100%.</li>
          <li>There are failing tests.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The goals for this exercise are:
        </p>
          <ol>
          <li>Fix the broken tests. Be aware that the statechart and the test cases may have failures.</li>
          <li>Add further tests cases to cover all requirements.</li>
          <li>Try to reach 100% coverage.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>
          These are the requirements: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>R1: three differently coloured lights: red (R), green (G), yellow (Y)​</li>
            <li>R2: at most one light is on at any point in time​</li>
            <li>R3: at system start-up, the red light is on​</li>
            <li>R4: cycles through red on, green on, and yellow on​</li>
            <li>R5: red is on for 60s, green is on for 55s, yellow is on for 5s​</li>
          </ul>
