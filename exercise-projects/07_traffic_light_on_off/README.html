    <h3>Exercise 7</h3>
    <h2>Switching traffic light on and off</h2>
    <p>Add another hierarchy level that supports switching on and off the coomplete traffic light.
      Go into detail with shallow and deep histories.

    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>R9a: The traffic light can be switched on and off.</li>
      <li>R9b: The traffic light is initially off.</li>
      <li>R9c: If the traffic light is off nocht light is on.</li>
      <li>R9d: After switching off and on again the traffic light must switch on the previously activated light.</li> 
    </ul>

      <h1>Model the feature</h1>
      <p>
        Follow the same procedure as in previous exercises.
        <ol>
          <li>Take a look at <i>specification/SwitchOnOffSpecification.sctunit</i>. These test cases are already complete and checks all the requirements defined above. 
            It will fail on the first run.</li>
          <li>Extend the stetchart. All required declarations are already in place.</li>
          <li>While you are extending the statechart run the test suite <i>TestTrafficLight.sctunit</i>. It contains the new interrupt specification and 
            all previously defined tests. Running this suit makes sure that no regressions occur.</li>
          <li>Continue from 2. until all tests are green. You should also have no uncovered model elements.</li>
        </ol>
