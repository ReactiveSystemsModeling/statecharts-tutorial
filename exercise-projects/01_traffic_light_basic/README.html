    <h3>Exercise 1</h3>
    <h2>Basic Traffic Light</h2>
    <p>In this exercise you will model and simulate a statechart of a basic traffic light.</p>
    <p>
        <img class="standard-image" alt="The statechart"
          src="resources/doc/statechart.png" />
      </p>
   </div>  

  <div class="body-container">

    <p></p>

    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <p>
      The traffic light statechart must implement the follwoing requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>R1: three differently coloured lights: red (R), green (G), yellow (Y)​</li>
      <li>R2: at most one light is on at any point in time​</li>
      <li>R3: at system start-up, the red light is on​</li>
      <li>R4: cycles through red on, green on, and yellow on​</li>
      <li>R5: red is on for 60s, green is on for 55s, yellow is on for 5s​</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Extend the statechart</h1>
      <p>
        You have to extend the prepared statechart using the YAKINDU statechart editor.
      </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Open the statechart <b>TrafficLight.sct</b> by double-clicking the file in the project explorer.</li>
        <li>Follow the hints which are provided as comments in the model and add states, transitions, and declarations.</li>
        <li>Define trigger and actions on the transition. Remember the syntax is '<i>trigger</i> / <i>action</i>'</li>
        <li>Use time trigger (e.g. after 10s). </li>
        <li>Hint: Try Ctrl-Space when editing text to get proposals.</li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Simulate the statechart</h1>
      <p>
        Any time while modeling you can run the simulation to check if everything is working 
        according to the requirements. Simply right-click in the model and choose 'Run As > Statechart Simulation' 
        from the context menu. You can even edit the statechart durin simulation. When you save the changes you will 
        be asked to twerminate or restart the simulation.
