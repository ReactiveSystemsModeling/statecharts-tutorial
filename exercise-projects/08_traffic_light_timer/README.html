    <h3>Exercise 8</h3>
    <h2>Traffic light with timer</h2>
    <p>In this exercise a timer must be modeled. It introduces using orthogonal regions. </p>

    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>R10: A timer displays the remaining time while the light is red or green</li>
      <li>R10a: This timer decreases and displays its value every second.</li>
      <li>R10b: The colour of the timer reflects the colour of the traffic light.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Model the feature</h1>
      <p>
        The interface is already prepared. You schould add all required variables and local events in the <i>internal:</i> declaration scope.
        Follow the same procedure as in previous exercises.
        <ol>
          <li>Take a look at <i>specification/TimerSpecification.sctunit</i>. These test cases are already complete and checks all the requirements defined above. 
            It will fail on the first run.</li>
          <li>Extend the stetchart. All required declarations are already in place.</li>
          <li>While you are extending the statechart run the test suite <i>TestTrafficLight.sctunit</i>. It contains the new interrupt specification and 
            all previously defined tests. Running this suit makes sure that no regressions occur.</li>
          <li>Continue from 2. until all tests are green. You should also have no uncovered model elements.</li>
        </ol>
