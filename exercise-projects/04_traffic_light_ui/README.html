      <h3>Exercise 4</h3>
      <h2>Integrate generated traffic light statechart to Java UI</h2>
  
      <p>Statecharts define reactive behavior that interacts with the environment. 
        In this exercise code is generated from the traffic light statechart. 
        This code is then integrated with a graphical UI of the traffic light.

                    <td>This is a launch configuration that you can use to start the UI application. 
                      Simply right-click and choosee "Run As > 04-Run-UI".</td>
                  </tr>

                    <td>sc.sgen</td>
                    <td>This is the configuration for the code generator. This is required to generate code.</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <h1>Inspect the code generator model</h1>
            <p>
              Open the <i>sc.sgen</i> file. The content is explained by comments in the file.
            </p>  

            <h1>Inspect the generated code</h1>
            <p>
              The source code is located in the folder <i>src</i>. You can find the generated state machine code 
              in the Java package <i>traffic.light.trafficlightctrl</i>. Take a look at the interface definition 
              <i>ITrafficLightCtrlStatemachine.java</i> to get familiar with the state machines API. 
              <i>TrafficLightCtrlStatemachine.java</i> contains the implementation.
            </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <h1>Integrate the state machine</h1>
          <p>
            The statemachine is not yet attached to the UI. 
            Open the Java class <i>TrafficLightDemo.java</i> in <i>src/traffic.light</i> and follow the instructions that you'll 
            find in the source code comments.
          </p>
          

        <h1>Run the UI</h1>
          <p>
            If you have implemented the state machines event listerners you can run the application.
            Select the file <i>04-Run-UI.launch</i> in the project explorer. 
            Right-click the entry and select "Run As > 04-Run-UI". This will
            launch the UI (see screenshot). 
            You can observe how the traffic light cycles through the different phases.
            This UI includes elements like buttons 
            which do not work yet but will be integrated in the next exercises.
