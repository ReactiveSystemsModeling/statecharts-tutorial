    <h3>Exercise 6</h3>
    <h2>Traffic Light Restores State</h2>
    <p>This exercise highlighte the use of histories. When resuming from interrupted mode the last active light color should be restored.
      Here again the tests are prepared.

    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <p>
      Just one requirement is changed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>R8a: when â€‹regular operation is resumed the traffic light restarts with the last active light color red (R), green (G), or yellow (Y) on.</li>
    </ul>

      <h1>Model the interrupt feature</h1>
      <p>
        Follow the same procedure as in exercise 5.
        <ol>
          <li>Take a look at <i>specification/InterruptSpecification.sctunit</i>. These test cases are already complete and checks all the requirements defined above. 
            It will fail on the first run.</li>
          <li>Extend the stetchart. All required declarations are already in place.</li>
          <li>While you are extending the statechart run the test suite <i>TestTrafficLight.sctunit</i>. It contains the new interrupt specification and 
            all previously defined tests. Running this suit makes sure that no regressions occur.</li>
          <li>Continue from 2. until all tests are green. You should also have no uncovered model elements.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
