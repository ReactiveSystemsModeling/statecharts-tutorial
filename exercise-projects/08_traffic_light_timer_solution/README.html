    <h3>Solution 8</h3>
    <h2>Taffic light with timer</h2>
    <p>In this exercise an orthogonal region is used to model a timer. 
      The result should be comparable to the follwing statechart... </p>

    <h2>How does the model cover the requirements?</h2>  
    <div class="table-responsive">

        <tr>
          <td>R10a: This timer decreases and displays its value every second.</td>
          <td>An internal variable for the counter is introduced. Wehn switching e traffic light phase the counter value is set to the 
            time period of the phase. Additionally the local evemts <i>resetTimer</i>, <i>enableTimer</i>, and <i>disableTimer</i> 
            are used to synchronize traffic light phase switches with the timer.

          <td>R10b: The colour of the timer reflects the colour of the traffic light.</td>
