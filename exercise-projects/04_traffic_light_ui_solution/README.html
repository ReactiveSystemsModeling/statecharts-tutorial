        <h3>Solution 4</h3>
        <h2>Integrate generated traffic light statechart into Java UI</h2>
    
        <p>In this execise code is generated from the traffic light statechart. The generated state machine is 
          integrated with the manually written Java application that displays a traffic light.

                The most interesting parts are the generated state machine classes in the Java package <i>traffic.light.trafficlightctrl</i> 
                and the application class <i>TrafficLightDemo</i> which gives an example how to setr up and integrate the generated state machine code.

          <div class="col-sm-4">
              <img class="standard-image" alt="Testing a traffic light" 
              src="resources/doc/trafficlight.png" />
    
          </div>
        </div>  
          <h1>Run the UI</h1>
            <p>
              If you have implemented the state machines event listerners you can run the application.
              Select the file <i>04-Run-UI.launch</i> in the project explorer. 
              Right-click the entry and select "Run As > 04-Solution-Run-UI". This will
              launch the UI (see screenshot). 
              You can observe how the traffic light cycles through the different phases.
              This UI includes elements like buttons 
              which do not work yet but will be integrated in the next exercises.
